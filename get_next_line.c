**		return a (0), letting the reader know that it is the END OF FILE.
**	If something out of the ordinary happens, then the function deems this to be

** ft_get_line - This function's purpose is to read a line.It takes 3 parameters
**		as argument. It will take an int representing a file descriptor fd. It
**		takes a string 'char *' which it manipulates within the function. It
**		also takes a static char that's used through the running process to keep
**		track of where it is reading. This function calls ft_read in a while
**		loop to ensure that it is still appropriate to 'ft_get_line'.
**	HOW IT WORKS:
**	It places what is read and places it into a temporary string 'tmp'. The int
**		cfdp: (Control File Descriptor Process) is used to keep track of the
**		status of the file. If cfdp is > 0, then things are fine. If cfdp is 0
**		the file is done reading. If it is < 0, an error has occurred. The
**		function ft_read manages this concurrently. The 'tmp' string is given
**		the value of 'stat_char' in the fd (file descriptor). This function does
**		not free the string 'tmp', it deletes it at its address. The address of
**		the 'buffer' is also deleted of its contents.
**		The value of the CFDP determines how the function exits and whether to
**		GET_NEXT_LINE (1) / CLOSE (-1) / ERROR (-1)

**	get_next_line - This function takes input from given/chosen file descriptor
**		It takes two parameters as an argument. The first is the file descriptor
**		that will be read, the second is the address of a pointer to a character
**		that will be used to save the line read from the file descriptor. When
**		the reading is complete the function returns its result without '\n'.
**	cfdp - Control File Descriptor Process: This is an integer for keeping track
**		of which file descriptor is currently being handled.
**	buffer - This is a string created in the function of size BUFF_SIZE, through
**		the function 'ft_strnew' which uses malloc.
**	str - This variable is called in an if statement. Its purpose is to take the
**		remainder of the string that 'ft_strchr' will return after finding the
**		'\n' character in string 'pnt_to_fd[fd]'.
**	tmp - This variable is called in an if statement after the 'str' variable.
**		Its purpose is to take the first part of the string pointed to by
**		'pnt_to_fd' after it has been separated by the '\n' character using the
**		'ft_strchr' function.
**	pnt_to_fd - This static char is used to keep track of where there the 'file
**		descriptor' is currently pointing. It moves as per the 'BUFF_SIZE' until
**		it reaches the 'EndOfFile', defined as the '0' point.
**	This function uses a ternary operator to control its final return. This is
**		due to norminette 25 line limit only. It used to be:
**		if (ft_strlen(*line) > 0)
**			return (1);
**		return (0);
