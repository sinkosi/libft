# libft
Libft Project - Rewrite some of the standard c libraries

# Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

# How To Use LIBFT
After cloning the repository, run the Makefile.

Create a main and include libft.h

Create any C file you wish and call the function you desire using ft_ prefix to the standard
function you would call in C. There are additional functions that exist which are not included
in the standard C Library. To find these functions and there uses. Check 'libft.h', this will
operate similar to the man.
